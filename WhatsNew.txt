0.61	Combine 'custom' keyword with others, e.g. 'since-last-time custom' in a nightly script if you only 
	want to submit your own changes, but not Oracle-delivered fixes/bugs (this will keep your repository
	size small, but you won't be able to tell if a customization has been wiped out by a bundle).
	
0.60	New feature for processing multiple environments: 'ancestor' property. For newly added PeopleCode segments,
	'ancestor' versions of the code will first be submitted, so that the version control history
	will show (typically) DEMO > PROD > DEV > later versions in DEV. See 'Setting up version control.pdf'.

0.55	Fix for bug #16 ("can't find PSPCMPROG record" multiple environments). 

0.54	Fix for bug #15 ('Large PeopleCode files get truncated'). Query on PSPCMTXT was wrong. No more need for 
	'AlwaysDecode' line in properties file.

0.53	Fix where-clause for Application Package PeopleCode in project; improve filter for invalid characters in file name.

0.52	Read plain-text PeopleCode from table PSPCMTXT, if it exists (tools >= 8.52)

0.51	Fix for missing file extension (.pcode/.last_update) and mangled peoplecode
	contents (bug introduced with v0.46)

0.50	New script: DecodePCODE_Git.bat, for submitting to Git repository.

0.46	Changes to ensure valid directory names (also affecting SVN path).

0.45	No new features, but somewhat more forgiving of unexpected values of PSSQLDEFN.SQLID.

0.44	Process SQLs with SQLTYPE other than 2 (standalone/AppEngine/other); improve three-way merge report and documentation.

0.43	Parse byte code 83 = 'Doc'; substitute invalid characters in directory path; close SQL cursors

0.42	Two fixes in query used for extracting ppc for project: one to make it process Application Package ppc,
	one to correct problem that manifests itself only with MS SQL Server.

0.41	Added 'OPRID' parameter to select on LASTUPDOPRID

0.40	Support for application upgrades: attempts three-way merge of PeopleCode segments. 
	Results available via Browser Report.See "Using DecodePCODE_Merge.pdf".

0.36	Fix for null pointer exception when PSSQLDEFN.LASTUPDDTTM is NULL. Also preconfigured
	the Oracle 5 JDBC driver in the .bat files, and updated the README.

0.35    Fix for processing Component Record Field peoplecode. Store SQL for specific DBTYPEs and for non-"GBL" markets
	in separate directories

0.34	Changes in SVN folder creation. Added document 'Setting up version control.pdf'.

0.32	Small change in example decodePC.properties file (commenting out second and third processing specification); Added this file.

0.31 	Fix for creating folders / submitting files when using http:// protocol (worked only for svn:// protocol).

0.30	Allows parallel processing of several PeopleSoft environments, with PeopleCode/SQL text being committed to separate branches in 
	SVN (or written to separate directory trees).

0.20	Supports committing PeopleCode/SQL text to Subversion.

0.11	Output some text to the console to show output path.

0.10	First version on SourceForge. Can extract data from PeopleTools tables (decoding PeopleCode bytecode and/or reading SQL text) and 
	save it to files; can also extract PeopleCode and SQL text from PeopleTools .xml project files.
