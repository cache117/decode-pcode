# decode-pcode
DecodePCODE v0.61

## Forward Note
This repository was taken and modified from https://sourceforge.net/projects/decodepcode/, which is maintained by Eric H.

The current version contains a few scripts, to be used from a command line, to extract PeopleCode and SQL text from either a PeopleTools project file or directly from PeopleTools tables (using direct, read-only database access). 

If a PTools project file is read, .pcode files are produced exactly as they appear in Application Designer. 

If you have ptools >= 8.52, the PeopleCode is read from table PSPCMTXT.

Otherwise, the bytecode in the PSPCMPROG table is decoded and while this works quite well, the .pcode files it produces are not always formatted precisely as in AppDesigner. 

The produced files can either be saved to the local file system, or submitted to a version control system (currently, Subversion (SVN) and Git are supported). 

The app can also process several environments (e.g. DEV and TEST) in one go, saving each environment's version of a PeopleCode object to a separate directory or to a separate SVN/Git folder. Alternatively,using the 'ancestor' directive, the tool can save the various versions of newly added objects (e.g. DEMO, PROD, DEV) to the same branch, so that the objects' history shows the customizations.

There is also a script to attempt three-way merging of PeopleCode, especially useful for functional upgrades. 


## DecodePCODE.bat:

Connects to a database, reads PeopleCode bytecode and SQL definitions from the PeopleTools tables, and writes the decoded PeopleCode and the SQL text to the file system (below a top directory that you specify in the .properties file)

Usage: e.g.

DecodePCODE.bat PPLTLS88CUR

(Connects to the database and uses this project definition to determine what PeopleCode segments and SQL definitions to extract)

DecodePCODE.bat custom

(all PeopleCode/SQL with LASTUPDOPRID <> 'PPLSOFT')

DecodePCODE.bat since 2011/01/01

(LASTUPDDTTM on or after the specified day)

DecodePCODE.bat since-days 7

(same, but relative to current date)

DecodePCODE.bat since-last-time

(this reads a file 'last-time.txt' , which is created by this program whenever it runs with one of the 'since' parameters. You may want to use this command in a recurrent job)

DecodePCODE.bat since-last-time custom

(same, but only code with LASTUPDOPRID <> 'PPLSOFT'. Note that while this will keep your repository free of delivered code, it means you won't be able to tell if a bundle has wiped out a customization)


DecodePCODE.bat since 2012/01/01 oprid JOHNNY

(parameter 'OPRID' can be combined with 'custom' or any of the 'since' parameters; it adds a 'LASTUPDOPRID = ...' clause to the selects)

DecodePCODE.bat PPLTLS88CUR.xml

(Reads a PeopleTools project file, and extracts all PeopleCode segments it contains, as well as the SQL definitions)

## DecodePCODE_SVN.bat

This script accepts the same parameters as DecodePCODE.bat, but instead of writing the extracted text to files, it submits it to a Subversion (SVN) version control system. Connection parameters for SVN should be entered in DecodePC.properties. You can specify more than one SVN user in the properties; the program will try to map each PeopleSoft user (LASTUPDOPRID) to an SVN user.

## DecodePCODE_Git.bat

To submit the extracted text to a local Git repository (which will be created if it does not already exist).

## DecodePCODE_Merge.bat

Extracts PeopleCode from a compare report and from a PeopleTools .xml project,and attempts to merge the three versions of each PeopleCode segment. Modifies the (browser) compare report that was used for input, adding links to various version of the PeopleCode as well as to diffs.

See 'Using DecodePCODE_Merge.pdf'.

# Installation:

Extract the .zip file, and ensure a suitable JDBC library is available in the working directory: sqljdbc4.jar for MS SQL Server, ojdbc6.jar for Oracle (retrieve from the vendor sites; the Oracle driver may also be found in jdbc/lib under the Oracle home). Other database types should work as well (adjust the url and driverclass entries, and specify the .jar file in the scripts).

If you want to commit files to Subversion, you need svnkit.jar (from svnkit.com; this program has been tested with the version included in org.tmatesoft.svn_1.3.5.standalone.zip). 

If you want to commit files to a Git repository, you will need jgit.jar (from http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/download, pick the 'Raw API library' and rename the file).

See 'Setting up version tracking.pdf' for more details on using Subversion or Git with this application.

Specify the connection parameters in DecodePC.properties. For Oracle, you can use tnsping to determine server and port number.

For all three .bat files, you may have to specify the path for java (JRE 1.5+ required). You may be able to use $PS_HOME/jre/bin/java. Ensure that the classpath parameters (the .jar files) exist.

Note that the batch files need to be started from the base directory (with the subdirectory 'bin').

Installation on Unix: same, but use the .sh scripts instead of the batch files. You will have to do something like 

	chmod 700 *.sh
	
first. In Unix, the entries in the classpath are separated by :, not ; .

# Miscellaneous:

Minimum persissions for the SQL user that you specify in the .properties file:

select rights on PSPCMPROG PSPCMNAME PSSQLDEFN PSSQLTEXTDEFN PSPROJECTITEM PSPACKAGEDEFN and (ptools >= 8.52) PSPCMTXT; 

no insert/delete/alter permissions required.
